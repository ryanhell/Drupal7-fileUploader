Drupal 7 File Upload Module

Objectives:
The objective of this module is not to create the first file uploader for Drupal 7. Instead, this module 
will demonstrate some web skills and teach the participant a bit about the Drupal custom module development
scene within GitHub.

What is needed:
The current client is an educational institution. They have a simple form that needs to be filled out in order to get
new students enrolled. This form exist in an application. Ideally the application form could be hosted on their 
website (Drupal 7), then signed and returned via a web based file uploader.

Languages Needed:
PHP5, HTML, and possibly a touch of MySQL

Timeline:
no immediate hurries, just for fun
